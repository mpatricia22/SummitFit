                    <h3>Our history</h3>
                    <p>SummitFit was born in 2022! Dublin opened in January,2022, followed by the first location outside
                        Dublin,&nbsp; Cork City in May 2022! SummitFit is the first commercial gym to have a heated
                        chamber. The heated chamber is now available in Dublin & Cork too.At SummitFit we're here to
                        provide a unique environment in which anyone – and we mean anyone – can be comfortable. A
                        diverse, Judgement Free Zone® where a lasting, active lifestyle can be built. Our product is a
                        tool, a means to an end; not a brand name or a mold-maker, but a tool that can be used by
                        anyone. In the end, it’s all about you. As we evolve and educate ourselves, we will seek to
                        perfect this safe, energetic environment, where everyone feels accepted and respected. We are
                        not here to kiss your butt, only to kick it if that’s what you need.</p>
